# Hi! I'm Peter

I made this website to show a model of me [T-Posing](https://roblox-bloody-battle.fandom.com/wiki/T-Pose) üëç

I like adding links to trick [Google](https://www.google.com) into thinking I have a better website, and adding buzzwords to pad out sentence length.

## About Me
I'm a recent graduate from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) with a [B.S. in Computer Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad), and a new [software engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) working on [Bluetooth Audio](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/recent-enhancements/le-audio/) support for the Windows platform.

I enjoy working with hardware and systems level code. I led the [UWROV](https://uwrov.org/) software team for two years, where I transitioned our control system into [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) and created a [containerized environment](https://www.docker.com/) to make [asyncrhonous development](https://coronavirus.wa.gov/) easier.

I'm a [technologist at heart](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/teentitans/images/a/a3/Cyborg.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/244?cb=20200906210223), and am very excited to see and learn how [new technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) can be used to make our [lives easier](https://www.stby.eu/wp_15/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wall-E-2-fat-humans-1024x426.jpg).
