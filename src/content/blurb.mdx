# Hi! I'm Peter

I made this website to show a model of me [T-Posing](https://roblox-bloody-battle.fandom.com/wiki/T-Pose) üëç

I like adding links to trick [<strike>Google</strike> Bing](https://www.bing.com) into thinking I have a better website, and adding buzzwords to pad out sentence length.

## About Me
I'm a recent graduate from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) with a [B.S. in Computer Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad), and a new [software engineer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/software-engineer) at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) working on [Bluetooth Audio](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/recent-enhancements/le-audio/) support for the [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) platform.

I enjoy working with [hardware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) and [systems level code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death). I led the [UWROV](https://uwrov.org/) software team for two years, where I transitioned our control system into [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) and created a [containerized development environment](https://www.docker.com/) to make [asynchronous collaboration](https://coronavirus.wa.gov/) easier.

I'm a [technologist at heart](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RM80m2o4h6iJfeLFVmgQugSwRBw=/0x0:1920x1080/920x613/filters:focal(802x210:1108x516):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57555003/cyborg.0.png), and am very excited to see and learn how [new technologies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50167812) can be used to make our [lives easier](https://www.stby.eu/wp_15/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wall-E-2-fat-humans-1024x426.jpg).
