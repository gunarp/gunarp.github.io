# About

I specialize in rapidly building software companies and web applications. I use an entrepreneurial mindset to inform my design and engineering output.

I prioritize communication while building. I use screencasts, video calls, and written words to lead teams built on trust and transparency.

I am an expert in JavaScript, working primarily in React and Firebase, but I have experience working in a wide range of technologies including Node & Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React Native, Gatsby, REST API design, CircleCI, 3rd party APIs (Stripe, Discord, Slack, Amplitude, Google Auth, etc.), AWS (S3, CloudFront, Cognito, Build Pipeline, Route53, ACM), Cypress testing, and many more.

Additionally, I am an experienced interface and user experience designer. I use Figma to communicate ideas through low and high fidelity mockups, design systems, and clickable prototypes.

## This website

I built this website in late December, 2019 and then released v2 in May 2020. The code is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/RyanWarner/ryan.warner.codes), and the design is publically available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/yLWWKJQsPVB06wlXfddg8H/ryan.warner.codes?node-id=2%3A314).
