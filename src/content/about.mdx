# About Me And This Website

I'm a (very soon to be) fresh grad in Computer Engineering from the University of Washington. I'm currently working at [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/) as a Software Engineer.
I started programming in my first year of college and have been absolutely loving ever since!

I have nearly zero experience with front end technologies - most of my experience comes from school courses and my robotics club.
I also want to keep my writing skills up to snuff, so creating a website seemed like a great way to kill two birds with one stone!

This website is under construction because I haven't thought out a lot of the content yet, I'll add in new items eventually (maybe)!

The main reason I wanted to make this website was to showcase a 3D model of me [t-posing](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/t-pose) on the front page.
I figured that if I made a website to show the model, I might as well make the rest of the site ðŸ˜….

If you're interested, the code for both this website and my resume are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gunarp/personal.site). Both come from templates I found online.
Big ups to [Sourabh Bajaj](https://github.com/sb2nov) and [Ryan Warner](https://github.com/RyanWarner) for providing easy to use templates!
